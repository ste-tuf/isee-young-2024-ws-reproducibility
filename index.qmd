title: "Elevate your research with reproducibility science practices: a R workshop for young researcher in epidemiology"
author: "Stephane Tuffier"
date: 2024-06-05
---

This workshop aims to provide young epidemiology researchers knowledge
and skills to increase reproducibility of their research.

The first part of the workshop will begin by defining reproducibility
and its importance in epidemiology, exploring associated challenges and
opportunities. In the second part of the workshop, focus will be put on practical 
solutions and their application so that young
researchers can implement in their analysis and writing.
