This workshop aims to provide young epidemiology researchers knowledge
and skills needed to increase reproducibility of their research.

The first part of the workshop will begin by defining reproducibility
and its importance in epidemiology, exploring associated challenges and
opportunities. Focus will be put on practical solutions that young
researchers can implement in their analysis and writing.

In the second part of the workshop, participants will learn how to start
reproducible projects and incorporate best data management and coding
practices, inspired by data science and open-source worlds. We will
introduce participants to collaboration tools like Git, Git-Hub, and
several R packages that improve analysis and code reproducibility,
including quarto, purrr, targets, gt. The workshop will conclude with
hands-on exercises, enabling participants to apply this tools by
themselves. Pre-workshop materials including package installation
scripts, data sets, R scripts, will be shared and freely accessible on
Git-Hub.

This workshop aims to give young epidemiology researchers the knowledge and skills needed to enhance the reproducibility of their research. The first part of the workshop will begin by defining reproducibility and its importance in epidemiology, exploring associated challenges and opportunities. Besides study design and research good practices, focus will be put on practical solutions that young researchers can implement in their analysis and writing. In the second part of the workshop, participants will learn how to start reproducible projects and incorporate best data management and coding practices, inspired by data science and open-source worlds. We will introduce participants to collaboration tools like Git, Git-Hub, and several R packages that improve analysis and code reproducibility, including `quarto`, `purrr`, `targets`, `gt`. The workshop will conclude with hands-on exercises, enabling participants to apply these learnings by themselves.

It is promising that some leaders in epidemiology (22, 23, 77) and journals are encouraging open science. Early-career epidemiologists could also play a key role. Indeed, in the social sciences, early-career researchers have led numerous replication studies and founded research networks to facilitate their conduct (2, 78), founded journals that incentivize open-science practices (79), developed software to identify incorrect statistical reporting in papers (80), and founded a multinational network of journal clubs covering open-science practices (ReproducibilitiTea, https://reproducibilitea.org/)
