**2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing for Reproducibility (15 minutes):**
  - Discuss the role of data cleaning and preprocessing in preparing high-quality, reproducible datasets.
- Provide guidelines for identifying and handling missing data, outliers, and other common issues.
- Share best practices for documenting data cleaning procedures.
- Reference materials:
  - **Book:** "Data Wrangling with R" by Bradley Boehmke. [Link](https://bradleyboehmke.github.io/data_wrangling/)

**3. Metadata and Codebook Creation (15 minutes):**
  - Introduce the concept of metadata and its importance in providing context for datasets.
- Discuss the creation of codebooks to document variable definitions, coding schemes, and any transformations applied to the data.
- Showcase examples of well-documented metadata and codebooks.
