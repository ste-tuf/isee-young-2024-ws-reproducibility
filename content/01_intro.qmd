**Session 1: Understanding Reproducibility (30 minutes)**
  
  **1. Defining Reproducibility and its Significance (10 minutes):**
  - Provide a clear definition of reproducibility in the context of epidemiology research, emphasizing the ability to replicate study results using the same data and methods.
- Highlight the importance of reproducibility for building trust in scientific findings and facilitating the validation of research outcomes.

**2. Common Challenges in Achieving Reproducibility in Epidemiology (10 minutes):**
  - Discuss typical challenges and pitfalls in epidemiology research that hinder reproducibility, such as data manipulation errors, lack of transparency, and inadequate documentation.
- Share examples of well-known cases where reproducibility issues have affected the credibility of research.

**3. Real-World Examples and Case Studies (10 minutes):**
  - Present real-world examples and case studies that illustrate the impact of reproducibility on epidemiological research.
- Include instances of successful reproducibility and its positive effects on the scientific community.

  - **Paper:** Nosek, B. A., Alter, G., Banks, G. C., Borsboom, D., Bowman, S. D., Breckler, S. J., ... & Contestabile, M. (2015). Promoting an open research culture. Science, 348(6242), 1422-1425. [Link](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/348/6242/1422)

**Hands-on Activity: Reproducibility Challenge (30 minutes):**
  - Engage participants in a short activity where they assess the reproducibility of a provided research paper or study.
- Encourage them to identify potential challenges and propose solutions for improving reproducibility in the selected case.
- Facilitate group discussions to share insights and findings.
